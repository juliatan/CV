Julia Tan
=========

Having realised that computers and the internet are infiltrating into ever increasing aspects of our daily lives, I decided to change career paths from investment banking, to learn how to code and co-found a tech startup in 2014.

Since the start of 2020, I have sold and exited my startup [Peg], started a new company [Robin], aiming to tackle food waste and climate change, and (sadly) ended my new company Robin after 6 months.

Examples of my coding work can be found on my [Github].

Recent hobby coding projects
----------------------------

| [Movie Browser] | [Burger Builder] | [LinkedIn Puppeteer Scraper] |
|:------------ |:----------- | :----------- |
| Practice project written from scratch to practice along to the "Harvard CS50 Mobile Apps React Native" course. Uses React Native, Expo and the Open Movie Database API. | Code-along project to the "React - Complete Guide" course. Uses React, React Router, Redux and Firebase (WIP). | Automated LinkedIn scraping for sales lead generation using Javascript and Puppeteer. Data from LinkedIn and Cognism API. |

Bionic Julia (my [personal website]) is created & maintained with Ruby (ERB), SASS and Middleman. Deployed via Netlify.

I also enjoy playing around with different tools to try to automate tasks whilst learning new technologies. You can find a list of things I've made [here](https://bionicjulia.com/pages/coding).


Web development experience
--------------------------

### [Peg](https://peg.co)
**Co-founder & Software Engineer / COO of Peg, a software company that helps global advertisers become influencer marketing gurus. (2014 - current)**

After graduating from Makers Academy, I co-founded Peg with Nic, a fellow Makers graduate, and Alex, our lead coach at Makers. During the initial 2 months when it was just Nic and myself, we used our new-found coding skills to design and create an MVP using Angular, which we released to the market in just 2 weeks. We then continued to iterate on our app based on user feedback.

When Alex joined, I worked alongside him to re-build the product from scratch, to ensure a more robust and speedy web app capable for scaling. The initial main technologies used included Ruby on Rails 4, Angular, RSpec and PostgreSQL.

I continued in my role as the principal software engineer under Alex until 2018. Sroop joined us as our first developer hire after a year of starting Peg, and between the 3 of us, we covered all of the backend and frontend code base. As the company grew, I transitioned away from code and into the COO position. I resumed my software engineer role in Sep 2019, as the company's focus at that point was preparing for an impending sale and exit. Our software architecture has grown and evolved massively since the early days, and now involve technologies like Ruby on Rails 6, React 16, PostgreSQL 11, Redis, Vue, Node, Gatsby and Docker.

I currently remain on the board of directors, but am now searching for my next challenge in tech.


### Technical skillset (in my specific role as Software Engineer)

  - Ruby
  - Ruby on Rails 4 (a bit of 6)
  - PostgreSQL (mostly 9)

### [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com)
**Highly selective, 12 week web development bootcamp in London (May-August 2014)**

After leaving the world of finance (see below) and taking a 5 month solo travel trip, I made the leap into web development by immersing myself in code for 3 months at Makers Academy, where I learnt the latest web app technologies, techniques and best practices, in a project-based course with pair-programming and test-driven development at its core.

Previous professional experience
----------

I have spent over 6 years as an Investment Banker in London, starting out in Mergers and Acquisitions in HSBC before moving into Debt Advisory at a boutique investment bank. I have therefore had experience of working in both large and small companies and teams. Past clients have mostly been UK and European private equity firms, as well as mid-cap companies with valuations of c.£150-200 million.

The vast majority of my past experience has been project-based, working in teams of around 3 to 4 people. I am used to delivering high quality work under tight, client-driven deadlines. My past roles have been client-facing, where I was expected to prepare and present project findings and financial models.
